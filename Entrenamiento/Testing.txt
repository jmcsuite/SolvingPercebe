Testing should be done methodically.
You should follow steps, so that you minimize
the computer time and the testing time.

1.- Check for output format //Most common WA
2.- Check for input format // Check that you are reading N-1 lines in trees for example, and that input is correct
3.- Add logs in different checkpoints to test different ideas. 
4.- Compile with all WARNINGs
5.- Check Multicase

At this point you print the result and the code and 
you start debugging this:

1.- Small manual test case. (run through your code manually)
2.- Smallest answer, biggest answer, no answer, all types of answers.
3.- Max test for array overflow, integer overflow.
4.- Cornen cases, smallest n.
5.- Equal numbers, if two numbers aren't specified to be distinct, 
then they can be the same
6.-Degenerate, empty set, three points in a line, a 
graph that is a line.

After you check for this, manually do some cases, draw them
get the answer, then put them in a computer an check for differences



Last step is stress testing, but this is the LAST RESORT
